It's just a working title... Until something better appears.

## Aim

We aim to empower local commnities and initiatives by providing a decentralized
platform to discover, communicate and collaborate.
We want to support generative and censorship-resistant discussions that are
curated, ranked and moderated by the users themselves.


> In envisioning a marketplace for open speech platforms that support more generative and
censorship-resistant discussions, we recommend focusing on supporting existing efforts that
provide alternatives to Facebookâ€™s opaque curation and ranking. These alternatives might look
more like Reddit's sub-communities, with different rule sets to enable different types of
conversation, overseen and administered by members of the community with a system for due
process when contentious issues arise.
